Description:

Compete against a number of A.I. bots that evolve over time.  Uses NEAT, a genetic programming module
that evolves neural networks.  Each A.I. bot is controlled by its own neural network.
The neural networks are evaulated by a fitness function on their performance to see how much they
will contribute to the next "population" of bots to play against the human player.

Libraries used:

pygame
neat
